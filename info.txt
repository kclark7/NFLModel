All stats and data collected is being neatly added and cleaned in this google drive folder:

The goal is to practice python for data analysis/visualization by completing a project that is fun to me, as I watch the NFL every week.
It is also giving me some excel (many Vlookups have been used) and github practice
Future plans include saving the data in a DB2 table to practice SQL w/ python 
and post to use tableau as well.
