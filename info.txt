All stats and data collected is being neatly added and cleaned in this google drive folder:

The goal is to practice python for data analysis/visualization by completing a project that is fun to me, as I watch the NFL every week.
It is also giving me some excel (many Vlookups have been used) and github practice
Future plans include saving the data in a DB2 table to practice SQL w/ python 
and post to use tableau as well.

12/4/2021 Update: 
After testing different variables for their correlation with outcome, I have decided to use
3rd Down Conversion (.66 weight for offense), Red Zone Conversion rate (.66 weight for offense),
Yards per Drive (.66 weight for offense), turnover rate (.33 weight for offense), 
and points per drive (.66 weight for offense).
The r values, p values, and correlation coefficiants can be seen in TestVarCorr.ipynb
Penalties did not seem to be a good predictor, and pressure was iffy at p=.42 but I will try 
to find a new pressure stat that works better.
